# Chapter 11 - Measuring the Unmeasurable

## Fielding Percentage

The several deficiencies of the Fielding Pct. manifest since its inception: that one cannot commit an error on a ball one has not reached; that hometown scorers may look too kindly or too harshly upon the efforts of their lads, depending upon what seems to require protection, a pitcher's ERA or a fielder's errorless game streak; and that the statistic focused on failure rather than success.  Fielding Pct. was a far better measure of ability in the 1860s, when one play in four produced an error, than now, when only two plays in a hundred are flubbed.

When the number of errors diminishes to such an extent that the most surehanded shortstop fields 98.6 percent of the balls he reaches and the stone-fingered one reaches only 3.6 percent less, fielding percentage may be measuring gradations so fine as to approach meaningless.

With fielding percentage, as with any absolute statistic, the figures require a complex historical understanding in order to compare performances across time.

The weakness of the fielding percentage spills over into the primary measure of pitching effectiveness: the Earned Run Average. A team whose fielders are surehanded but have limited range may offer a defensive profile of ***good*** fielding and ***bad*** pitchine because only the pitcher suffers measurably for the fielders' shortcomings. To counter this injustice, James proposed a Defensive Efficiency Record, a measure of the percentage of all balls put into play that were converted into outs. This rating, however, suffers from an opposite to that of the ERA: Whereas the latter can mask an immobile, porous defense, the former can “protect*** a lousy pitching staff that allows many hard-hit balls that no one could convert into outs. All attempts to rate team fielding as an element of overall defense run up against this truth: Pitching and fielding are linked in so many complex ways that no matter how many of the links one uncouples, some remain intact.

## Total Chances per Game and Range Factor

The other individual statistic in use, at least by baseball's front offices, before the advent of sophisticated statistical analysis in the 1970s, was Total Chances Per Game. David Neft included TC/G in the first edition of The Baseball Encyclopedia  (1969) because he had read an interview in which Branch Rickey said he used the measure to evaluate fielding ability. So, it would seem, the statistic came into being somewhere between 1954, when Rickey wrote the remark which opens this chapter, and 1960. But Range Factor, which differs from TC/G only in that it does not include errors.

Range Factor has been attacked for a variety of shortcomings: Neft cannot comprehend why a misplayed ball should not count as an indicator of range; Barry Codell has argued that errors need not be nonevents but rather should be subtracted from Total Chances(Net would add them) before dividing by games. Others have argued that a fielder's number of chances may be dependent upon such variables as: (1) grass vs. turf; (2) a predominantly lefthanded or righthanded pitching staff (3) the strikeouts registered by the pitching staff-more strikeouts mean fewer fielding plays and generally fewer ground balls; (4) the winning percentage on the road, where a poor team will more often than not record only 24 outs in the field; (5) home-park dimensions where fielders may average fewer chances because of crazily configured fields; (6) you name it. Still, James believed that Range Factor was a far better indicator of ability than anything else around.

James effectively countered most of the arguments against Range Factor by acknowledging some shortcomings( which stat has none?) and dismissing others with a convincing array of evidence. But he did not deal satisfạctorily with the question of errors. Neft may have been right to consider a mishandled ball an indicator of range if not efficiency, but it violates one's sense of fair play to see a measure of an individual's ability boosted by a play which hurts his team. Codell's alternative, to subtract errors from total chances, implies that muffing a routine play may be balanced by successfully handling another, but this is not so, as explained in the paragraph below. And Range Factor treats the error as a nonevent, in the same league with the basehit, which does not count against a fielder's record, but this too is statistically invalid: Errors may be infrequent, but they are not insignificant.

An error hurts a team more than a routine putout or assist helps it, for it transforms into a hit(in effect) a batted ball which should have produced an out. A double play is worth more than simply two outs. The Double Play is valuable, but it is also situation-dependent: The more baserunners the pitcher allows, the greater the opportunity for twin-killings.

Putouts and assists? As a rule, putouts are the significant stat for outfielders and assists for infielders, even first basemen, for the overwhelming majority of their putouts, including double plays. Outfield assists are of enormous defensive value, and their intimidating effect on runners contemplating an extra base must be reckoned, intuitively if not statistically. However, outfield assists have become four times less prevalent today than at the dawn of big-league play. On top of that, outfield assists are not necessarily the product of great arms.

## The Catcher

For catchers, we subtract strikeouts from putouts, an obvious step, left with a problem in that the remaining putouts are largely a function of the amount of foul territory in the catchers home park(the putout totals for other positions are affected too) and high assist totals are usually accompanied by a high number of stolen bases allowed.

A catcher's main defensive contribution is in calling the ballgame and keeping his pitcher in the proper frame of mind. Second in importance is his ability to throw(not only the would-be base thieves he intercepts, but also his demonstrated ability in the past which later keeps runners nailed to their bases).

Catcher’s assists are uniquely a product of fear, since the steal is an elective play; no matter how good a shortstop you are, you’re not going to prevent the other team from hitting the ball to you. The catcher is the only fielder whom opponents can deny the chance to strut his stuff.

## Fielding Saves Runs

The batting championship is not awarded to the batter who looks the best or who won it in the past, nor is the ERA title, but fielding is more deceptive: It’s hard to become convinced that one must trust the numbers rather than one’s eyes. Fielding may be a far less important part of the game than batting or pitching, but the superlative fielder can save as many runs beyond the average as a front-rank pitcher or, less frequently, a top hitter.
