# Chapter 2 - What's Wrong with Traditional Baseball Statistics

Baseball, though simple in essence, was intricate in its detail and thus peculiarity suited to quantification.

## Batting Average

Time has given the batting average a powerful hold on the American baseball public. Batting Average treats all hits in egalitarian fashion. A two-out bunt single in the ninth with no one on base and your team trailing by six runs counts the same as a “shot heard ‘round the world”.

So in attempting to asses batting excellence with the solitary yardstick of the batting average we tend to diminish the accomplishments of (a) the extra base hitter, whose blows have a greater run scoring potential, both for him and whoever men may be on base; (b) the batter whose talent it is to extract walks from pitchers who do not wish to put him on base, or whose power is such that pitchers will take their chances working the corners of the plate rather than risk an extra base hit; (c) the batter whose misfortune it is to be playing in a period dominated by pitching; and (d) the man whose hits are few but are well-timed or clutch. En resumen el BA is an unweighted average; it fails to account for at least one significant offensive category( not to mention hit by pitch, sacrifices, steals, and grounded into double play); it does not permit cross-era comparison; and it does not indicate value of the team.

The batting average has retained its primacy for so long because it affords the illusion that what is being measured in isolation is pure ability, ability apart from situation. But because such traditional stats are not normalized to league average nor adjusted for home park, nor weighted properly, all you have is the illusion of purely individual accountability, while in fact the stats are extremely situation-dependent.

The ability to reach base and to produce runs are not adequately measured by the batting average.

## Slugging Percentage

The slugging percentage does acknowledge the role of the man whose talent is for the long ball and who may, with management’s blessing, be sacrificing bat control and thus batting average( slugging percentage is the number of total bases divided by at bats rather than hits by at bats, which is the BA ). But the slugging percentage has its problems too.

It declares that a double is worth two singles, that a triple is worth 1.5 doubles, and that a home run is worth four singles. All of these proportions relate to the number of bases touched in each hit, but in terms of the hit’s value in generating runs, the proportions are wrong. A home run in four at bats is not worth as much as four singles, for instance, in part because the run potential of the four singles is greater, in part because the man who hit four singles didn’t also make three outs; yet the man who goes one for four at the plate, that one being a homer, has the same slugging percentage of 1.000 as a man who singles four times in four at bats.

Moreover, is possible to attain a high slugging percentage without being a slugger. Even a bunt single boosts not only your batting average, but also your slugging percentage. Other things that slugging percentage does not do are: indicate how many runs were produced by the hits; give any credit for other offensive categories, such as walks, hit by pitch, or steals; permit the comparison of sluggers from different eras.

## On Base Percentage

The On Base Percentage(OBP) has the advantage of giving credit to walks and hit by pitch, but it is an unweighted average and thus makes no distinction between those two events, and say, a grand slam homer. Hitters with a lot of speed, no power, and no patience are exposed by the OBP even if their batting average was looks respectable or excellent. In short, OBP does tell you more about a man’s ability to get on than BA does, and thus is a better indicator of run generation, but it is not good enough by itself to separate good hitters from average or poor ones.

BA, SLG and OBP free the batters accomplishment from those of his teammates.

## Runs Batted In

RBI’s? Don't they indicate run production and clutch ability? Yes and no. They tell how many runs a batter pushed across the plate, but they don’t tell how many fewer he might have driven if he had batted eight rather than fourth, or how many more he might have driven into a team in on a team that put more men on base. They don’t even tell how many more runs a batter might have driven if he had delivered a higher proportion of his hits with men on base.

The RBI does tell you something about run-producing ability, but not enough: It is a situation-dependant statistic, inextricably tied to factors which vary wildly for individuals in the same teams or on others. Moreover, the RBI makes no distinction between being hit by a pitch to or a home-run.

## Home Runs

Home Runs are the offense’s most productive weapon. But statistically, it’s useless because it is a counter stat( it simply tells you how many, not when or how). They won’t tell us whose hits produced more extra bases, who made the fewest outs proportionate to his times at bat, and so on. There’s nothing wrong with them if all we ask them to do is to tell us how many. It’s when we attempt to make more of them that we overextend their usefulness. A man with a lot of stolen bases is not necessarily the best baserunner; he might have been caught as often as he stole and thus have cost his team many runs on balance. A man with the most triples is not necessarily a slugger or speed merchant; he probably plays half of the games in a park conductive to triples.

## Hits

Hits? High numbers are largely a function of at bats.

## Runs

Runs? They are situation dependent. Today you still need to get to first base in order to score a run, but if you are playing for a poor offensive team, you get left on base a lot. Scoring a large number of runs is a function not only of a team you play for, but also of the position you occupy in the batting order. You are not going to find anybody leading the league in runs ( or any other offensive category ) batting seventh or eight.

Runs has become the least interesting stat of today; it’s odd that runs remain the essence of baseball, remain the key to victory.

The evident belief that runs are produced by only those who score them or drive them home, when in fact the “man in the middle” whose offensive contribution is to advance baserunners through a hit, walk or HBP, slips between the statistical cracks.

## Wins

Wins are a team statistic, obviously, as are losses, but we credit a win entirely to one pitcher in one game. Why not the short-stop or the left fielder or some combination of the three? Several players may have had more to do with the win than any pitcher.

To win many games a pitcher generally must play for a team which wins many games or must benefit from extraordinary support in his start or must allow so few runs that even his team’s meager offense will be enough. Verdict on both the wins and the win percentage: situational-dependant.

Wins were and are not a good statistic, for the simple reason that one may pitch poorly and win, or pitch well and lose.

## Earned Run Average

The natural corrective to this deficiency of the win percentage is the earned run average. The purpose of the earned run average is noble: to give a pitcher a credit for doing what he can do to prevent runs from scoring, aside from his own fielding lapses and those of the men around him. It succeeds to a remarkable extent in isolating the performance of the pitcher from his situation, but objections to the statistic remain.

The pitcher with a bad defense behind him is going to be hurt less by errors than by the balls that wind up recorded as base hits which a superior defensive team might have stopped. Bottom line: You pitch for a bad club, you get hurt.

What gave rise to the ERA, and what we appreciate about it, is that like batting average it is an attempt at an isolating stat, a measure of individual performance not dependent upon one’s own team.

Win percentage and ERA may hurt pitchers who are laboring for poor teams.

The poorer the teams defense, the more earned runs, as well as unearned runs will be charged to the pitcher.

## StrikeOuts

The strikeout is, as it always has been, just another way to make an out. Yes it is a sure way to register an out without the risk of advancing baserunners and so is highly useful in a situation like man on third with fewer than two outs; otherwise, it is a vastly overrated stat because it has nothing to do with victory or defeat - it is mere spectacle. A high total indicates raw talent and overpowering stuff, but the imperative of the pitcher is simply to retire the batter, not to crush him.

The task of the pithcer is not to deny basehits or baserunners, but to deny runs.

## Bases on Balls

It is possible to survive even to excel, without first-rate control, provided your stuff is good enough to hold down the number of hits. It doesn’t matter how many men a pitcher puts in base. The only really significant metric for pitchers is runs.

## Completed Games

What does Completed Games mean? Only that the pitcher accepted no assistance. CG’s are situation-dependent, to a fatal degree. CG’s tell you as much about the manager and his evaluation of his bullpen as they tell you about the arm or heart of the pitcher.

## Saves

The need of this metric arose because relievers operated at a disadvantage when it came to picking up wins, and at an advantage in ERA. The save is clearly another statistic that hinges on game situations and managerial discretion.

## Fielding Percentage

The central weakness of fielding percentage is well known: You can’t make an error on a ball you don’t touch. To counter the weakness in fielding percentage and to credit the plays made as well as the plays not made, total chances per game is useful statistic ( and when errors are deducted from chances, you get Range Factor ).

Another difficulty with the fielding percentage is that to understand what figure represents average performance( and thus be able to identify inferior and superior fielders ) one must adjust for position.

## Double Play

High double play totals are believed to indicate excellence among middle infielders, but the more double plays a club turns, as a rule, the lousier the pitching. If the pitchers are putting a lot of men on base, the team can get a lot of double plays even without a great fielding shortstop and second baseman.

In other words, what we have with the new statistics is simplicity arising from complexity. What is a single worth or a walk or a homer in terms of its run-producing capacity? How valuable is a stolen base?
