# Chapter 15 - Rumblings in the Pantheon

The number is what it is, a statement of the number of wins a player or pitcher accounted for over his career beyond what the average player might have contributed in his place.

There may still be ample reason to admire the man on a personal and even a professional level, for he may excel in something we are not measuring( intestinal fortitude, clutch ability, or a peculiar knack in a narrow area of performance, like the ability to hit homers or doubles, or to strike out battalions of batters.

## Player Win Total

The Overall Player Win Total makes no differentiation between a run contributed by batting, fielding, or base stealing the object of the game is to score runs while denying them to the opposition, and any run contributed or denied is of equal value (in the aggregate, of  course; in any given game, similar events have different values accord. to their contexts).

Because of the nature of difficult to the game, it is more difficult to amass a high LWTS Run/Win total with the glove or with the legs than it is with the bat, yet a high Batting Win total may shrink dramatically for the player (along with his value to his team) by poor fielding or reckless baserunning. In other words, a team who registers 50 Batting Wins but whose fielding is 5 Wins below average is not as good a player as another who contributes 40 Wins with his bat, 5 with his glove, and another 5 with his base stealing.

## Hall of Fame

In the Hall of fame, there are some men that were rewarded for consistently superior play over the long haul, despite few flashes of brilliance. Some benefited from an association with a string of pennant winners; others from anecdotal accomplishments handed down as lore; still others from superior press agentry. A few men rode an extraordinary single season into the Hall, and a few who shall remain nameless have been elected/selected for reasons not entirely related to their accomplishments.

How do men of merit not get elected to the Hall of Fame? Moral Lapses; ethical/legal slips in the future delay or negate of chances; lack of media attention combined with superior play during the war years of 1943-45; No World Series; Low totals in the glamor stats.

What gets a man in, what keeps him out? All that counts is performance(to what extent did the manâ€™s efforts translate into additional runs and therefore wins for his team?) The men who contribute the most Wins are the best players( the most productive, the most valuable.)
