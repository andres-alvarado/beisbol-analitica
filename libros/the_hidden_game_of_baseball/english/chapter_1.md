# Chapter 1 - The Music of the Sphere and Ash

What’s in a number? The answer to “How many?” . An absolute number like 3509, or 715 ( the home-run record once thought invulnerable) does not resound with meaning unless it is placed into some context which will give it life.

We inevitably look to the number as a means of encapsulating and comprehending experience. Statistics are themselves the vital part of baseball, the only tangible and imperishable remains of games played yesterday or a hundred years ago.

Baseball may be lobed without statistics, but it cannot be understood without them. Statistics are what make baseball a sport rather than a spectacle, what make its past worthy of our interest as well as its present. Statistics increase our understanding of the game and deepen our enjoyment.

Many people who find “real life” too much for them, or at least a source of turmoil and anxiety, derive immense satisfaction from the order, regularity, justice and essential stability if baseball, and this goes a long way toward explaining its continuing appeal to adults. The lure, the tease, for baseball statisticians is that the mathematical universe in which the game is played can be fully comprehended.

Even those who profess to abominate statistics ( among whom are included several baseball managers and ballplayers) are statisticians despites themselves, for we are all, all of us humans, intuitive statisticians. We base our actions upon a quick assimilation of similar experiences, weigh the results, and decide what to do.

In much the same way, a  manager who pinch-hits with a right handed batter when the opposing pilot brings a lefty reliever, nod did he perform any empirical study of the question, but based upon his thirty or forty years of observation and upon folk wisdom handed down to him, he assumes that statistically the right handed batter has a better chance of reaching base against the left handed pitcher. We are all statisticians, whenever we generalize from a group of specific, similar experiences; those of us who work with the numbers, though get more accurate results.

Dead Ball era strategies continue to be employed sixty years beyond the point at which they outlived their usefulness. Front office decisions are made on the basis of player-performance measures which tell next to nothing of a man’s value to his team.

We view performance  ( batting, pitching, fielding, baserunning ) in terms of its runs contributed or saved and within a context formed by the average level of performance prevailing.

Traditional statistics like batting average, were designed to identify individual accomplishments divorced from their effects on or by the team, and this can promote values contrary to thos of the team.
