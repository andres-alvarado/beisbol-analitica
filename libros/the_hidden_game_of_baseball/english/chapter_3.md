# Chapter 3 - The New Statistics

Sabermetrics is a different approach to the whole question of what baseball statistics as for ( that they are not brass knuckles to beat a barroom adversary with, but tools for achieving a better understanding of the game and heightening one’s pleasure on it ).

Sabermetrics is the mathematical and statistical analysis of baseball records. Sabermetrics introduces new evidence, previously unknown data derived from original source material. Also, “sabermetrics puts into place formulas, schematic designs, theories of relationship which would compare not only this player to that one, but to any other player who might be introduced into the discussion.

Strip the game and its stats to their essentials and start again, this time remembering that individual stats came into being as an attempt to apportion the players’ contributions to achieving victory, for that is what the game is about.

Traditional baseball statistics don’t give an adequate sense of an individual's trustworth or of a team’s prospects of victory.

A new statistic, one that directly measures a player’s ability both to score and drive in runs.

The total number of runs a team scores in a season is proportional to some combination of hits, walks, steals and other factors that result in batters getting on base or advancing other runners.

The advisability of a particular strategy must be judged not only in terms of the situation on the bases and the number of men out, but also with regard to the inning and score.

Sabermetrics consists of finding things in the existing data that were not seen before, or collecting the data which makes possible the application of new statistics to old performances.

Normalizing a statistic to its league average is a valuable analytical tool if employed logically. Another worthwhile adjustment to various average is for home park effects, a park factor, if you will.

The more ambitious the stat the more complex and arbitrary it becomes. What is gains in sophistication and the intuitive wisdom of its creator, it loses simplicity and objectivity. How can you love a stat or use it in arguments if you can’t really explain it.
